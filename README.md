📖 About the Project
This project builds a Product Recommender System using Machine Learning algorithms to suggest products based on user purchase history. The system employs advanced models like XGBoost and Random Forest, comparing their performance with various accuracy metrics.

📌 Features
✅ Product Recommendations based on purchase history
✅ Multiple AI Models: XGBoost & Random Forest
✅ Accuracy Comparisons: Accuracy, MSE, R² Score
✅ Interactive UI in Jupyter Notebook
✅ Efficient Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering

📊 Dataset Information
The dataset contains user transactions from Instacart, an online grocery shopping platform.

Orders: User purchase history
Products: Product details
Aisles & Departments: Categorization of products
