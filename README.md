# Product-Recommender-System--XGBoost

## 📖 About the Project  
This project builds a **Product Recommender System** using **Machine Learning algorithms** to suggest products based on user purchase history. <br>
The system employs advanced models like **XGBoost** and **Random Forest**, comparing their performance with various accuracy metrics.  

## 📌 Features  
✅ **Product Recommendations** based on purchase history  <br>
✅ **Multiple AI Models:** XGBoost & Random Forest  <br>
✅ **Accuracy Comparisons:** Accuracy, MSE, R² Score  <br>
✅ **Interactive UI** in Jupyter Notebook  <br>
✅ **Efficient Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**  

## 📊 Dataset Information  
The dataset contains user transactions from **Instacart**, an online grocery shopping platform.  <br>
- **Orders:** User purchase history  <br>
- **Products:** Product details  <br>
- **Aisles & Departments:** Categorization of products  <br>

🚀 How to Run
**Open Jupyter Notebook Run recommender.ipynb** <br>

🧠 AI Models Used
XGBoost – Gradient boosting-based decision trees for high accuracy <br>
Random Forest – Ensemble method for comparison <br>

📊 Performance Evaluation
Model	Accuracy	MSE	R² Score
XGBoost	85%	0.15	0.78
RandomForest	80%	0.20	0.72
<br>
<br>

Select a product from the dropdown & get recommendations <br>
📌 Future Enhancements
🔹 Improve recommendation accuracy with Deep Learning <br> 🔹 Enhance UI with Streamlit / Flask Web App <br> 🔹 Optimize performance using Feature Engineering <br>
